# password-generator

for this project I was tasked with making a random password generator.

initially the generator will ask how long of a password you want and if you want numbers, symbols, uppercase letters, and lowercase letters.

pick 'ok' for the type of characters you want included in your random password.

pick 'cancel' if you do not want that type of character in your password.

after types of characters are selected, press the generate password button to get a random password.

press the copy button to copy the generated password.
